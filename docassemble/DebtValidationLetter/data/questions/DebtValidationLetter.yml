  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: DVL_intro
continue button field: DebtValidation_intro
question: |
  Debt Validation Request Letter
subquestion: |
  Has a debt collector recently called or sent you a demand letter about a debt you aren't sure you owe? Or a debt where the amount is higher than it should be? You can use this tool to draft a letter to a debt collector requesting they validate and provide more information about a debt they are trying to collect from you, and disputing that debt.
  
  <h3>Not sure if this is the right tool for you?</h3> 
  <ul>
  <li>This tool will help you draft a letter to a debt collector <strong>who first contacted you in the last 30 days</strong> about a debt. The letter will ask for certain rights and protections you have as a consumer, like getting verification of the amount of the debt, and who owns it.</li>
  <li>NOTE: Even though you shouldn’t use this tool if you were first contacted by your debt collector over 30 days ago, you can still dispute the debt later, including in court!</li>
  <li>You can learn more about dealing with debt collectors in our article <a href="https://www.ptla.org/debt-collectors-are-calling-me-what-can-i-do">Debt collectors are calling me. What can I do?</a></li>
  <li>We also offer a <a href="https://apps.ptla.org/start/stopcollections/">Maine Stop Collection Letter</a> (if you are dealing with an unsecured debt like a credit card and your income and property are exempt from collections under Maine law) and a <a href="https://apps.ptla.org/start/debthelper/">Debt Collection Hearing Helper</a> if you are being sued for a debt or need to go to a 'disclosure hearing.'</li>
  </ul>
  
  <strong>If this is the right tool for you, let’s get started!</strong>

  This tool will create a letter saying that you do not believe you owe this debt or the amount is wrong.  If you would like the letter to give any more details about why you dispute the debt, please write them here. The tool will add what you write to the first paragraph of your letter.   
  
  You can leave the box blank. You are not required to give more details to preserve your rights. But if you have information about why you don't owe the debt, or the amount claimed, giving more information may help resolve a dispute in your favor.
  
  You can also include documents with your letter when you send it to the collector. You may want to send copies of documents showing you don't owe the debt or the amount they are trying to collect. Examples could include proof of payment, proof you had your identity stolen and reported it to the creditor, or proof that you are not the account holder.
